## Introduction

This project revolves around the paper titled "**ESM2_AMP: an Interpretable Framework for Protein-protein Interactions Prediction and Biological Mechanism Discovery**", aiming to provide relevant datasets and model resources. Through our framework, we hope to enhance the understanding of protein interactions and their underlying biological mechanisms, offering robust support for research in related fields.

## Dataset Availability

This project provides training datasets and independent test sets for researchers to explore further. All data resources can be accessed in the [Datasets](https://github.com/ywwy-qn/ESM2_AMP/tree/main/Datasets#dataset) section. Detailed information on methods for extracting feature representations from protein sequences can be found in the published research paper (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbad534), as well as in the corresponding GitHub repository: [Feature Representation for LLMs](https://github.com/yujuan-zhang/feature-representation-for-LLMs?tab=readme-ov-file#feature-representation-model).

## Models

This project encompasses a series of models, including [ESM2_AMPS](https://github.com/ywwy-qn/ESM2_AMP/tree/main/Models/ESM2_AMPS), [ESM2_AMP_CSE](https://github.com/ywwy-qn/ESM2_AMP/tree/main/Models/ESM2_AMP_CSE), and [ESM2_DPM](https://github.com/ywwy-qn/ESM2_AMP/tree/main/Models/ESM2_DPM), aimed at providing comprehensive support for predicting protein interactions. Example inference code for each model is provided within their respective directories, while the required model weight files can be downloaded from the project's corresponding [figshare](https://figshare.com/account/items/28378157) page.

**Important Note**: As the associated research papers are officially published, this project will continuously update and improve to better serve the scientific research community.
