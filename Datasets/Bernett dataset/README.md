# Bernett dataset

The Bernett dataset is a rigorously partitioned human dataset designed to prevent data leakage. After removing proteins with more than 4000 amino acids, the final dataset contains 20,303 proteins distributed across three subsets:

Training set: 79,961 positive samples and 79,983 negative samples,

Validation set: 29,334 positive samples and 29,327 negative samples,

Test set: 25,957 positive samples and 25,956 negative samples.

The files are organized as follows:

**Test_Negative_samples.xlsx** contains the test set negative samples;

**Test_Positive_samples.xlsx** contains the test set positive samples;

**Train_Negative_samples.xlsx** contains the training set negative samples;

**Train_Positive_samples.xlsx** contains the training set positive samples;

**Val_Negative_samples.xlsx** contains the validation set negative samples;

**Val_Positive_samples.xlsx** contains the validation set positive samples;

**Total_proteins.xlsx** contains the collection of all proteins.
