# Pan_dataset
Pan_dataset is a human protein-protein interaction dataset, where protein samples have been filtered to retain only sequences with lengths between 15 and 4000 amino acids. A training set was constructed by randomly sampling protein interaction pairs at a 1:1 ratio, resulting in 36,092 positive pairs and 36,092 negative pairs (totaling 72,184 pairs). The file **Positive_samples.xlsx** contains the collection of positive samples; the file **Negative_samples.xlsx** contains the collection of negative samples; and the file **total_protein.xlsx** includes all proteins contained in this dataset.
